### Data
The first portion of data is available from fig share containing molecule names, SMILES, and docking score against 25 unique targets: [https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Protein-Ligand_Docking_Surrogate_Models_SARS-CoV-2_Benchmark_for_Deep_LearningAccelerated_Virtual_Screening/14745234](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Protein-Ligand_Docking_Surrogate_Models_SARS-CoV-2_Benchmark_for_Deep_LearningAccelerated_Virtual_Screening/14745234)

A further release of larger portions of data will be avilable in the next day.
